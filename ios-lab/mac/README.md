# ios-lab on macOS

Native path: Xcode + iOS Simulator + Appium XCUITest. This is the supported
Apple stack and the only practical path on Apple Silicon.

## Setup

```bash
cd ..
make mac-doctor
make mac-setup
make mac-setup INSTALL=1   # Homebrew + Node + Appium + XCUITest
bash ios-lab/mac/appium.sh install   # only Appium: no sudo, installed under ~/.oslab/appium
```

The dashboard's **Install Appium** button (macOS Lab page, or This computer) runs `appium.sh install` with a step-by-step progress bar. It installs Node with Homebrew only if Node 20.19+/22.12+ is missing, then Appium and the XCUITest driver into `~/.oslab/appium` (override with `OSLAB_APPIUM_HOME`); no administrator rights or global npm directory. `appium.sh start` and the host tool check use that copy, or one already on `PATH`.

`mac-setup` never installs Xcode itself. Install Xcode from the App Store or
Apple Developer downloads, open it once, accept the licence, and install a
simulator runtime from **Xcode > Settings > Components**.

Configuration lives in `config.env` (copied from `config.env.example`):

```bash
SIM_DEVICE="iPhone 16 Pro"
IOS_RUNTIME=latest
APPIUM_HOST=127.0.0.1
APPIUM_PORT=4723
APPIUM_LOG=artifacts/appium.log
BOOT_TIMEOUT=300
```

Use a preset:

```bash
make mac-profiles
make mac-profile PROFILE=iphone
make mac-profile PROFILE=ipad
make mac-profile PROFILE=legacy
```

## Lifecycle

```bash
make mac-sim
make mac-status
make mac-appium
make mac-appium-stop
make mac-stop
```

The simulator scripts use `xcrun simctl`. `run-simulator.sh` falls back to the
first available iPhone when the configured device is not installed.

## Notes

- Xcode and the Simulator are large; keep 30 GB+ free.
- Appium XCUITest builds WebDriverAgent on first use; the first session is
  slower and may need Xcode signed in.
- A physical iPhone needs a development team and provisioning profile.
- Simulators are not a security boundary; use a dedicated user or disposable
  VM for untrusted apps.
- For CI, use a real macOS runner with Xcode rather than the Linux container
  path.
